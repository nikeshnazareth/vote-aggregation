<title>Ethereum Vote Aggregation</title>
<h1>Ethereum Vote Aggregation</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Standard Ethereum voting contracts could benefit from a mechanism to aggregate votes offline and efficiently validate and tally them on-chain. Here is a proposed design based on the Kate Polynomial Commitment scheme and BLS signatures, which are both gaining traction in the Ethereum community. I'm a few steps out of my depth, and there are parts of the design that need to be hardened, so feedback and corrections are most welcome.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<h3>Kate Polynomial Commitments</h3>
<p>The scheme is defined <a href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/asiacrypt2010/6477178/6477178.pdf">here</a>. In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>A polynomial can be defined by its coefficient terms (ie. the <span class="code">a<sub>i</sub></span> values in <span class="code">P(x) = a<sub>0</sub> + a<sub>1</sub>·x + a<sub>2</sub>·x<sup>2</sup> + ...</span> )<ul>
<li>We could also define a polynomial by its evaluations [ <span class="code">Q(0)=a<sub>0</sub>; Q(1)=a<sub>1</sub>; Q(2)=a<sub>2</sub>; ...</span>]</li>
<li>I learned this topic from ultra Ethereum researcher Justin Drake <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbNauD5wgXM">who claims</a> that we can work in evaluation form more easily, but I couldn't understand how the "dot product" or "bitmap" (explained below) would work, so I'm going to continue describing this scheme using coefficients</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note that in this context, a polynomial is just a mechanism to manipulate and reason about a large number of arbitrary different values. In our case, we're interested in performing aggregate operations on votes.</li>
<li>There is a mechanism to <em>commit</em> to a polynomial. The final result is a constant-sized element. I will denote a commitment to a polynomial <span class="code">P(x)</span> as <span class="com">P(x)</span>.</li>
<li>Given a commitment, you can reveal any subset of points on the polynomial, along with another proof element. Assuming supporting infrastructure (the ability to do an elliptic curve pairing), we can check consistency of these values in constant time.</li>
<li>The commitments combine linearly:<ul>
<li>eg. <span class="code">2·<span class="com">P(x)</span> + 3·<span class="com">Q(x)</span> == <span class="com">(2·P(x) + 3·Q(x))</span></span></li>
<li>note: the notation I'm using is a little deceptive because the actual mathematical operations are slightly more complex, but I don't think it effects the bottleneck of the overall design.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We can quickly validate any claimed quadratic term:<ul>
<li>given <span class="com">a</span>, <span class="com">b</span> and <span class="com">c</span> we can check whether <span class="code">a·b == c</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The general strategy is to require users to pre-compute all relevant values (balances, votes, signatures, etc) and let the smart contract use these properties to verify that the equations hold and the values were calculated correctly.</p>
<p>There is a trusted setup that limits the maximum number of terms in the polynomial, but the linearity condition means we can mostly work around this by treating large polynomials as a psuedorandom combination of small polynomials.</p>
<h3>BLS Signatures</h3>
<p>This scheme requires users to sign messages with a BLS key pair. Signatures on the same message obey linearity, so if multiple users sign the same message, we can add all the signatures to get a combined signature <span class="code">S<sub>sum</sub></span>. We can also add all the public keys to get a combined public key <span class="code">PK<sub>sum</sub></span>. We only need to check the combined signature against the combined public key in order to demonstrate that all the signatures were valid.</p>
<h2>Polynomial Tricks</h2>
<h3>Low-degree proofs</h3>
<p>The trusted setup guarantees an upper limit <span class="code">N</span> to the degree of a committed polynomial. In order to prove that a committed polynomial <span class="com">P(x)</span> has a lower degree <span class="code">d</span>, the user can calculate <span class="code">Q(x) = x<sup>N-d</sup>·P(x)</span> and <span class="com">Q(x)</span>. The smart contract can use the commitments to validate the relationship (ie. that <span class="code">Q(x) = x<sup>N-d</sup>·P(x)</span>). This proves that the degree of <span class="code">Q(x)</span> is limited to <span class="code">N</span>, so the degree of <span class="code">P(x)</span> must be limited to <span class="code">d</span>.</p>
<h3>Revealing a coefficient</h3>
<p>We have a mechanism to reveal a particular point on the polynomial, but in this design, we don't care about any of the point evaluations, we only care about the coefficients.</p>
<p>If we have a commitment to the polynomial <span class="com">P(x)</span> and we want to reveal some coefficent <span class="code">a<sub>i</sub></span>, we can think of the polynomial as being comprised of three parts: the lower-degree terms, the target term and the higher degree terms <span class="code">P(x) = L(x) + a<sub>i</sub>·x<sup>i</sup> + x<sup>i+1</sup>·H(x)</span>. If the user creates a commitment to <span class="com">L(x)</span> and <span class="com">H(x)</span> and proves they have the right degree, the smart contract can check the equation, which validates the revealed <span class="code">a<sub>i</sub></span>.</p>
<h3>Dot product</h3>
<p>Consider two quadratic polynomials</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="code">a(x) = a<sub>0</sub> + a<sub>1</sub>x + a<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup></span></li>
<li><span class="code">b(x) = b<sub>0</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>x + b<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup></span></li>
</ul>
<p>We can reverse the order of coefficients in one of them, multiply the result by the other, and then investigate the second degree term:</p>
<p><span class="code">(a<sub>0</sub> + a<sub>1</sub>x + a<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup>)·(b<sub>2</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>x + b<sub>0</sub>x<sup>2</sup>)<br/>
= [ lower degree terms ] + (a<sub>0</sub>b<sub>0</sub> + a<sub>1</sub>b<sub>1</sub> +  a<sub>2</sub>b<sub>2</sub>)·x<sup>2</sup> + [ higher degree terms ]
</span></p>
<p>This term is the dot product between <span class="code">a</span> and <span class="code">b</span>.</p>
<p>More generally, given commitments to <span class="com">a</span> and <span class="com">b<sub>reversed</sup></span>, where both polynomials have degree <span class="code">d</span> that is half the trusted setup size, a user can calculate and commit to <span class="com">a·b<sub>reversed</sup></span>. This value can be checked by the smart contract. The user can then reveal the <span class="code">d<sup>th</sup></span> coefficient, which will correspond to the dot product between <span class="code">a</span> and <span class="code">b</span>.</p>
<p>Obligatory XKCD:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cryptography.png" alt="Obligatory XKCD" /></p>
<h3>Bitmap</h3>
<p>Consider a commitment to a polynomial <span class="com">P(x)</span> whose coefficients are claimed to be either 0 or 1. How can we test this claim?</p>
<p>The polynomial can be thought of as a bitmap, and <span class="code">P(2)</span> would evaluate to the number that the bitmap represents. The Kate scheme allows the user to reveal that value directly.</p>
<p>For example, if <span class="code">P(x) = 1·x<sup>2</sup> + 0·x<sup>1</sup> + 1·x<sup>0</sup></span>, then <span class="code">P(2) = 5</span>, which is <span class="code">101</span> in binary.</p>
<p>Let's define <span class="code">F(x)</span> as the polynomial with coefficients that are all 1. Then <span class="code">Q(x) = -P(x) + F(x)</span> should be the polynomial that inverts the coefficients of P(x) (all the 1s become 0s and vice versa).</p>
<p>The smart contract can use linearity to calculate <span class="com">Q(x)</span>, and the user can reveal <span class="code">Q(2)</span>. If <span class="code">P(x)</span> is a bitmap, then <span class="code">Q(2)</span> will be the bitwise inverse of <span class="code">P(2)</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, if <span class="code">P(x)</span> and <span class="code">Q(x)</span> are bitmaps, <span class="code">P(1)</span> and <span class="code">Q(1)</span> are the number of non-zero coefficients in each of the polynomials respectively. They should sum to <span class="code">F(1)</span>.</p>
<p> ⚠️ <strong>WARNING:</strong> I have not been able to construct a non-bitmap polynomial that passes both of these tests, but that's not a proof, of course. If this scheme turns out to be viable, it will require an efficient way to test if a polynomial is a bitmap. The one I described here may be suitable. In the rest of the document I will assume such a test exists.</p>
<h3>Sum all coefficients</h3>
<p>Given a commitment to a polynomial <span class="com">P(x)</span>, the Kate scheme allows a user to reveal <span class="code">P(1)</span>. This will correspond to the sum of all the coefficient terms.</p>
<h2>The protocol</h2>
<h3>Global state</h3>
<p>The protocol state is comprised of three polynomial commitments. For simplicity, I will assume the polynomial sizes are unbounded, or equivalently, the number of identities is less than half the size of the trusted setup. We should be able to handle more identities with another layer of complexity.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="com">BLS_KEYS</span> is a commitment to the BLS public keys of all known users. This defines an index for each identity (eg. the fifth coefficient corresponds to identity number 5). It is initialized to zero.</li>
<li><span class="com">SEQUENCES</span> is a commitment to the sequence numbers associated with the identities (to prevent replay attack). They are listed in the same order as the corresponding owner identities in <span class="code">BLS_KEYS</span>. It is initialized to zero.</li>
<li><span class="com">BALANCES</span> is a commitment to the token balances. They are listed in the same order as the corresponding owner identities in <span class="code">BLS_KEYS</span>. It is initialized to zero.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Registering</h3>
<p>To add a public key to <span class="com">BLS_KEYS</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>the user picks a zero coefficient on the polynomial (say position <span class="code">i</span>) and constructs a proof that reveals it (to be zero)</li>
<li>the user sends this proof and a new public key <span class="code">PK</span> to the contract</li>
<li>the contract validates the proof</li>
<li>the contract constructs a commitment to <span class="com">x<sup>i</sup>·PK</span></li>
<li>the contract updates <span class="code"><span class="com">BLS_KEYS</span> = <span class="com">BLS_KEYS</span> + <span class="com">x<sup>i</sup>·PK</span></span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Mint</h3>
<p>To mint tokens for the identity at position <span class="code">i</span>, using the identity at position <span class="code">j</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>the user constructs proofs to reveal<ul>
<li>the current balance at position <span class="code">i</span> of <span class="com">BALANCES</span></li>
<li>the public key at position <span class="code">j</span> of <span class="com">BLS_KEYS</span></li>
<li>the sequence number at position <span class="code">j</span> of <span class="com">SEQUENCES</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the user constructs a message consisting of these proof and the number of new tokens <span class="code">t</span></li>
<li>the user signs the message and sends it to the contract</li>
<li>the contract validates the proofs and signature</li>
<li>the contract validates that identity <span class="code">j</span> can mint tokens to position <span class="code">i</span></li>
<li>the contract checks to see if the balance would overflow</li>
<li>the contract constructs a commitment to <span class="com">x<sup>i</sup>·t</span></li>
<li>the contract updates <span class="code"><span class="com">BALANCES</span> = <span class="com">BALANCES</span> + <span class="com">x<sup>i</sup>·t</span></span></li>
<li>the contract retrieves the commitment to <span class="com">x<sup>j</sup></span></li>
<li>the contract updates <span class="code"><span class="com">SEQUENCES</span> = <span class="com">SEQUENCES</span> + <span class="com">x<sup>j</sup></span></span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Burn</h3>
<p>The mechanics of burning tokens is the same as minting them except the token commitment is subtracted from <span class="com">BALANCES</span> instead of added.</p>
<h3>Transfer</h3>
<p>A token transfer can be thought of as a burn and mint operation.</p>
<h3>Vote Initialization</h3>
<p>To initialize a vote:</p>
<ul>
<li>the contract saves a copy of <span class="com">BALANCES</span>. This effectively creates a snapshot that can be used for voting, while the original commitment can still be updated to allow token transfers.</li>
<li>the contract creates a commitment <span class="com">HAS_VOTED</span> and initializes it to zero.</li>
<li>the contract creates a <span class="code">tally</span> variable and initializes it to zero.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Public Voting (Option 1)</h3>
<p>I will assume each vote can be represented by -1 or 1 and that the final result is the sum of these votes, weighted by the balances. Note that using linearity, it's easy to map a simple set like this into a different set (eg. we can take 0s and 1s and map them to -1 and 1s). The scheme can also be extended with more options.</p>
<p>To conduct a vote:</p>
<ul>
<li>every user <span class="code">i</span> publishes a message containing their vote (eg. "On question abcd, I vote +1"), along with their signatures <span class="code">S<sub>i</sub></span></li>
<li>an aggregator takes an arbitrary subset of the ballots and divides them by the particular vote (the -1s are together, the +1s are together)</li>
<li>the aggregator creates <span class="code">SELECTION<sub>+1</sub></span> and <span class="code">SELECTION<sub>-1</sub></span> polynomials that "select" the corresponding identities.<ul>
<li>these are both bitmap polynomials, where a coefficient of 1 implies the identity matches the polynomial</li>
<li>the coefficients are specified in reverse order, so they can be used in a dot product (explained above)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the aggregator creates commitments to <span class="com">SELECTION<sub>+1</sub></span> and <span class="com">SELECTION<sub>-1</sub></span></li>
<li>the aggregator creates proofs that they are bitmaps</li>
<li>the aggregator creates a commitment to a <span class="com">SIGNATURES</span> polynomial that contains all the signatures in the same order as <span class="com">BLS_KEYS</span> (unused signatures can be set to zero)</li>
<li>note that the dot product between <span class="code">SIGNATURES</span> and <span class="code">SELECTION<sub>+1</sub></span> will be the sum of the signatures of the +1 voters. They all voted on the same message so BLS signature aggregation would apply. Similarly, the dot product between <span class="code">BLS_KEYS</span> and <span class="code">SELECTION<sub>+1</sub></span> will be the sum of their public keys. The same analysis applies to the -1 voters using the <span class="code">SELECTION<sub>-1</sub></span> polynomial. The aggregator calculates all these values, as well as the commitments required to prove that they're accurate (<span class="com">SIGNATURES·SELECTION<sub>+1</sub></span>, <span class="com"> BLS_KEYS·SELECTION<sub>+1</sub></span>, <span class="com">SIGNATURES·SELECTION<sub>-1</sub></span>, <span class="com">BLS_KEYS·SELECTION<sub>-1</sub></span>)</li>
<li>similarly, the dot product between <span class="code">BALANCES</span> and (<span class="code">SELECTION<sub>+1</sub> - SELECTION<sub>-1</sub></span>) is the signed sum of the votes, weighted by the corresponding balances. In other words, it's the tally represented by this subset of votes. The aggregator calculates this value and the proof element <span class="com">BALANCES·(SELECTION<sub>+1</sub> - SELECTION<sub>-1</sub>)</span></li>
<li>the aggregator sends all these values, commitments and proofs to the contract</li>
<li>the contract verifies all the proofs</li>
<li>the contract updates <span class="code"><span class="com">HAS_VOTED</span> = <span class="com">HAS_VOTED</span> + <span class="com">SELECTION<sub>+1</sub></span> + <span class="com">SELECTION<sub>-1</sub></span></span><ul>
<li>note that the selection polynomials have reversed coefficients so the identities are marked off in reverse order. That's okay because we're just looking for duplicates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the contract verifies that <span class="com">HAS_VOTED</span> is still a bitmap (otherwise, a voter will be double-counted)</li>
<li>the contract verifies both of the aggregated BLS signatures</li>
<li>the contract verifies that the expected message was signed by both groups</li>
<li>the contract scales the selection polynomial commitments by their values and combines them:<ul>
<li><span class="code"><span class="com">APPROVE</span> = <span class="com">SELECTION<sub>+1</sub></span></span></li>
<li><span class="code"><span class="com">REJECT</span> = -<span class="com">SELECTION<sub>-1</sub></span></span></li>
<li><span class="code"><span class="com">VOTE</span> = <span class="com">APPROVE</span> + <span class="com">REJECT</span> </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the contract confirms this is consistent with the tally proof</li>
<li>the contract updates the <span class="code">tally</span> variable accordingly</li>
</ul>
<p>The advantage of this scheme is that all the relevant calculations are performed off-chain by the aggregator. The contract can validate the effect a large number of ballots with a small number of constant-sized proof elements and constant-time checks. It should also be noted that this scheme is still censorship resistant because each update only requires a subset of the votes. Any votes that are ignored by the aggregator can be submitted in their own update.</p>
<h3>Hidden Voting (Option 2)</h3>
<p>The previous option only works if we're willing to aggregate votes in the open, which means voters can be influenced by the ballots of other voters. Many existing systems use a commit-reveal process to temporarily hide the votes. To that end, it's worth noting that the original <a href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/asiacrypt2010/6477178/6477178.pdf">Kate paper</a> includes a mechanism for masking a commitment and then revealing it. Our additional constraint is that the different terms in the eventual <span class="code">VOTE</span> polynomial correspond to different voters, so they need to be masked and unmasked individually without sacrificing the ability to perform aggregate calculations.</p>
<h4>Pedersen construction</h4>
<p>If the trusted setup supports it, it's possible to include a random number along with a Kate commitment in order to hide the commitment. I'll denote a blinded commitment to <span class="code">P(x)</span> with a blinding factor <span class="code">r</span> as <span class="com">P(x)</span><span class="blind">|r</span>. For our purposes, there are a few important properties of this blinded commitment:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is the same size as the original commitment, so blinding has minimal impact on bandwidth and computational requirements</li>
<li>a user can reveal <span class="code">r</span>, which allows anyone else to recover <span class="com">P(x)</span></li>
<li>it is binding. The user can't later "reveal" a different random value in order to retroactively change the commitment.</li>
<li>mathematically, it is equivalent to <span class="com">P(x) + λr</span>, where λ is unknown (it's an intrinsic property of the trusted setup)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, if I understand the mathematics correctly (which should be validated by a mathematician):</p>
<ul>
<li>instead of revealing <span class="code">r</span>, the user could reveal an unblinding commitment <span class="com">0</span><span class="blind">|-r</span>. This could be added to the original commitment to recover <span class="com">P(x)</span>. This allows for aggregate unblinding operations.</li>
<li>if the user revealed a different blinding factor <span class="code">x</span> with the same format (<span class="com">0</span><span class="blind">|x</span>), they cannot control (except by trial and error) the "recovered" <span class="com">P(x)</span>. So if <span class="com">P(x)</span> has enough structure that random modifications would be detectable, a malicious user could not change their commitment.</li>
<li>however, if a malicious user revealed an arbitrary unblinding commitment (with no enforced structure) that was naively added to their original commitment, they could control the "recovered" value, thereby changing their commitment.</li>
<li>therefore, the contract needs to validate the structure of unblinding commitments.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Procedure</h4>
<p>To conduct a vote:</p>
<ul>
<li>the user with identity <span class="code">i</span> in <span class="code">BLS_KEYS</span> hashes a message containing their vote (eg. "On question abcd, I vote +1") and uses this as the coefficient in a single-term polynomial with degree <span class="code">i</span> (ie. <span class="code">P<sub>i</sub>(x) = H(m)·x<sup>i</sup></span>)</li>
<li>they publish the blinded commitment <span class="com">P<sub>i</sub>(x)</span><span class="blind">|r<sub>i</sub></span></li>
<li>they also publish a low-degree and high-degree proof that the commitment only affects one term</li>
<li>any subset <span class="code">α</span> of users  can coordinate offline to sum their commitments to create <span class="com">VOTES<sub>α</sub></span><span class="blind">|r<sub>α</sub></span> and sign the result<ul>
<li>this will be a polynomial where the coefficient of the <span class="code">i<sup>th</sup></span> term is user <span class="code">i</span>'s blinded vote</li>
<li>since blinded votes will all be unique, users cannot aggregate their signatures if they only sign their component. This is why they sign the whole polynomial, which requires more coordination. If some users are non-cooperative, they can be excluded from the subset.</li>
<li>users will need to check the degree proofs to ensure other users are not interfering with their own term in the polynomial</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>as before (see Option 1 for details)<ul>
<li>an aggregator creates a <span class="code">SELECTION</span> polynomial that "selects" the corresponding identities, and a <span class="code">SIGNATURES</span> polynomial with all the signatures in the relevant positions</li>
<li>they provide all the necessary commitments and proofs so that the contract can verify (in aggregate) all relevant voter signatures and that <span class="com">HAS_VOTED</span> is updated accordingly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ideally, as each subset <span class="code">γ</span> of votes is submitted, the contract can add them to a global <span class="com">VOTES</span><span class="blind">|r</span> commitment<ul>
<li>however, we need to ensure <span class="com">VOTES<sub>γ</sub></span><span class="blind">|r<sub>γ</sub></span> doesn't affect any other voters</li>
<li>this seems like it should be possible, but my current design has a flaw:<ul>
<li>the contract constructs <span class="com">INVERTED_SELECTION<sub>γ</sub></span>, which flips the bits of <span class="com">SELECTION<sub>γ</sub></span> (see the <em>Bitmap</em> section above)</li>
<li>the users proves (and the contract validates) that the dot product <span class="com">INVERTED_SELECTION<sub>γ</sub>·VOTES<sub>γ</sub></span><span class="blind">|r<sub>γ</sub></span> is zero</li>
<li>this limits the attacks but does not prove these values are zero, because they may be non-zero values that add to zero</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if this cannot be resolved, we could require voter reveals to occur within their initial commitment subset<ul>
<li>this would add some storage overhead because we would need to save the individual <span class="com">SELECTION<sub>γ</sub></span> and <span class="com">VOTES<sub>γ</sub></span><span class="blind">|r<sub>γ</sub></span> commitments, and handle them separately</li>
<li>fortunately, it may not increase the number of elliptic curve pairing and BLS signature operations because an aggregate reveal that spans multiple <span class="com">SELECTION<sub>γ</sub></span> polynomials would involve checking multiple polynomial equations, and these can be pseudorandomly combined into a single equation:<ul>
<li>ie. for any two equations <span class="code">a·b == c</span> and <span class="code">x·y == z</span>, the contract could generate a pseudorandom <span class="code">r</span> and then combine them into <span class="code">a·b + r(x·y) == c + rz</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the <em>REVEAL</em> phase, any subset of voters can coordinate offline to sign and reveal their unblinding commitment<ul>
<li>the aggregator should supply selection polynomials <span class="code">SELECTION<sub>+1</sub></span> and <span class="code">SELECTION<sub>-1</sub></span> that select the users within each voting category. The overall <span class="code">SELECTION</span> is the sum of these two values.</li>
<li>we can use the same techniques to validate the signatures, prevent double-counting (with a <span class="com">HAS_REVEALED</span> bitmap) and ensure users don't interfere with other votes within the same subset<ul>
<li>as before, we may need to save each revealed subset to prevent users affect votes outside their subset</li>
<li>however, in this phase, it may be unnecessary because tampered votes are recoverable:<ul>
<li>tampering with votes that have already been revealed has no effect, since the vote has already been counted</li>
<li>assuming the consistency checks hold, tampering with a masked vote commitment <span class="code">i</span> simply adds a public value to the existing random blinding factor <span class="code">r<sub>i</sub></span>. This value could be incorporated into the subsequent unblinding commitment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>as noted above, the contract needs to confirm that the unblinding commitment has the form <span class="com">0</span><span class="blind">|r(x)</span><ul>
<li>the user just needs to supply  <span class="com">r(x)</span> and prove that <span class="code"><span class="com">0</span><span class="blind">|r(x)</span> == <span class="com">0</span><span class="blind">|1</span>·<span class="com">r(x)</span></span> </li>
<li>note the both sides of this equation are equivalent to <span class="com">λ·r(x)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the contract can unblind the subset of votes by adding the unblinding commitment to <span class="com">VOTES</span><span class="blind">|r</span></li>
<li>the aggregator can reveal and prove the sum of <span class="code">SELECTION<sub>+1</sub></span>, which is the number of voters <span class="code">p</span> in this subset who voted <em>Approve</em>. Similarly, they can reveal and prove the number of voters <span class="code">n</span> who voted <em>Reject</em>.</li>
<li>the aggregator should also provide proofs that<ul>
<li><span class="code">SELECTION<sub>+1</sub>·VOTES == p·H("On question abcd, I vote +1")</span></li>
<li><span class="code">SELECTION<sub>-1</sub>·VOTES == p·H("On question abcd, I vote -1")</span></li>
<li>theoretically, multiple users could coordinate so none of their commitments are valid, but they still add the sum of valid commitments. This is fine - they still need to choose their votes beforehand. Moreover, they can't use this technique to hijack with an unwilling voter's ballot because all users in the `SELECTION` need to sign the reveal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>as before, the contract can update <span class="code">tally</span> with <span class="code">BALANCES.(SELECTION<sub>+1</sub> - SELECTION<sub>-1</sub>)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
